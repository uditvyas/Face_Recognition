Probability and Random Processes

* The Assignment directory contains an ".ipynb" file that contains a self-sufficient code. The code contains text blocks that explain the working of the code at every step. 
* Upload the Code on Google Colab and run the cells as per requirements. The data and the supporting files are collected by the code itself from github. 
* The original dataset used can be found at this link - http://cbcl.mit.edu/software-datasets/heisele/facerecognition-database.html	
* The training of the Haar Classifier needs Colab or a Linux machine with libopencv-dev installed.
* The positive and the negative images were created using the file prepare_data.py, which is already present in the directory.
* DO NOT RUN the file prepare_data.py file, unless it is required to download more negative samples.
